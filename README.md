# Repository of the codefair material for the BOSC 2025 conference (July 20-24 2025)

## About

This repository contains the material and information associated with our poster presentation at the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) 2025. We are presenting Codefair, an open source and free GitHub app for making biomedical research software FAIR.

Codefair is your personal assistant to make research software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The [FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines](https://fair-biors.org/) provide actionable steps to make software FAIR, but complying with them can still be time-consuming and difficult. Codefair is designed to automate the process, letting researchers concentrate on the goals of their software. It is developed as a free and open source (MIT license) GitHub app. Once installed, Codefair seamlessly integrates into your existing workflow by monitoring your repository within GitHub using tools like Probot, providing feedback via a GitHub issue, allowing users to address them through user-friendly interfaces, and even submitting pull requests automatically to maintain continuous FAIR compliance. With thorough documentation and a design focused on ease-of-use, Codefair is accessible to all. When introduced at BOSC 2024 in an early development phase, Codefair primarily assisted researchers in adding essential metadata elements such as license, CITATION.cff, and codemeta.json. Since then, it has expanded to support streamlined archival on Zenodo and automated validation of Common Workflow Language (CWL) files. A new web dashboard enables easy assessment and management of FAIR compliance across your GitHub repositories. Usage of Codefair has also increased as it is now installed on over 400 GitHub repositories. By alleviating the time and effort needed for FAIR compliance, Codefair encourages biomedical researchers to embrace FAIR and open practices. In this presentation, we detail our development approach, outline current, discuss planned features, summarize updates since BOSC 2024, and invite the community to explore and contribute to [codefair.io](https://codefair.io/).
